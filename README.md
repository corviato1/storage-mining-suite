# The gyst 
Multi-chain storage provider pools.
## No premine, no counter productive greed(ie: no garbage sectors, no block reward *on applicable pools, no needless tx fees), tiered winpost(day, week, month) on sliding economic scale 


# Place in the market
First we saw coins.  Then it was storage.   After that was cross-chain coin swaps.   Next will be cross-chain storage.  Enter this project.
